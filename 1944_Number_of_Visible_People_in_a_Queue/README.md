## Problem Description

There are `n` people standing in a queue, and they numbered from `0` to `n - 1` in **left to right** order. You are given an array `heights` of distinct integers where `heights[i]` represents the height of the `ith` person.

A person can **see** another person to their right in the queue if everybody in between is `shorter` than both of them. More formally, the `ith` person can see the `jth` person if `i < j` and `min(heights[i], heights[j]) > max(heights[i+1], heights[i+2], ..., heights[j-1])`.

Return *an array `answer` of length `n` where `answer[i]` is the **number of people** the `ith` person can **see** to their right in the queue.*

## Examples
Example 1:
![Example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/29/queue-plane.jpg)
```
Input: heights = [10,6,8,5,11,9]
Output: [3,1,2,1,1,0]
Explanation:
Person 0 can see person 1, 2, and 4.
Person 1 can see person 2.
Person 2 can see person 3 and 4.
Person 3 can see person 4.
Person 4 can see person 5.
Person 5 can see no one since nobody is to the right of them.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: heights = [5,1,2,3,10]
Output: [4,1,1,1,0]
```
## Constraints

- `n == heights.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= heights[i] <= 10^5`
- All the values of `heights` are **unique**.

## Approach: Monotonic Stack

### Intuition

We notice that the number of people a person can see to their right is equal to the next person taller or same height to them and the number of people between them. Any person in between them who has a higher height neighbor to their left will be blocked. Therefore, we can use a monotonic stack from right to left, counting and popping shorter people to their right. 

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`
