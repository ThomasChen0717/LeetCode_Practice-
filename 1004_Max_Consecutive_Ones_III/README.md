## Problem Description
Given a binary array nums and an integer `k`, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most `k` 0's.
---

## Examples
Example 1: 
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
```
Example 2: 
```
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
```

## Approach

### Intuition

<Describe how you initially thought about the problem and why this direction makes sense.  
Mention why certain naive approaches may fail or be inefficient.>

### Key Observations

2. <Step 2>
3. <Step 3>

<If applicable, describe invariants or key properties maintained by the algorithm.>

### Correctness Argument (Optional but encouraged)

<Explain why the algorithm always produces the correct result.  
This can be informal but should clearly reference invariants or decisions made.>

### Complexity Analysis
