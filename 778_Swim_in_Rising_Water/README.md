## Problem Description

You are given an `n x n` integer matrix grid where each value `grid[i][j]` represents the elevation at that point `(i, j)`.

It starts raining, and water gradually rises over time. At time `t`, the water level is `t`, meaning any cell with elevation less than equal to `t` is submerged or reachable.

You can swim from a square to another 4-directionally adjacent square if and only if the elevation of both squares individually are at most `t`. You can swim infinite distances in zero time. Of course, you must stay within the boundaries of the grid during your swim.

Return the minimum time until you can reach the bottom right square `(n - 1, n - 1)` if you start at the top left square `(0, 0)`.

## Examples
Example 1:
```
Input: grid = [[0,2],[1,3]]
Output: 3
Explanation:
At time 0, you are in grid location (0, 0).
You cannot go anywhere else because 4-directionally adjacent neighbors have a higher elevation than t = 0.
You cannot reach point (1, 1) until time 3.
When the depth of water is 3, we can swim anywhere inside the grid.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: grid = [[0,1,2,3,4],[24,23,22,21,5],[12,13,14,15,16],[11,17,18,19,20],[10,9,8,7,6]]
Output: 16
Explanation: 
We need to wait until time 16 so that (0, 0) and (4, 4) are connected.
```

## Constraints

- `n == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 50`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] < n^2`
- Each value `grid[i][j]` is **unique**.

## Approach: Dijkstra's Algorithm 

### Intuition

Maintain a min heap to store the cells with the minimum elevation. 
Initially, we add the cell `(0, 0)` to the heap with its elevation as the key. 
We then repeatedly extract the cell with the minimum elevation from the heap and check if it is the bottom right square. 
If not, we add its 4-directionally adjacent cells to the heap with their elevations as the keys. 
We continue this process until we reach the bottom right square.
We keep a max variable to store the maximum elevation seen so far and a seen set to store the visited cells.


### Complexity Analysis
Let `n` be the size of the grid.
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n^2 log n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n^2)`
