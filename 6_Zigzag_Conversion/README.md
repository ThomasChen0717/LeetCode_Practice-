# 6_Zigzag Conversion

**Difficulty:** <span style="color:#f39c12"><b>Medium</b></span>  
**Topics:** String

## Problem Description

The string `"PAYPALISHIRING"` is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)
```
P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
```
And then read line by line: `"PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"`

Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:

`string convert(string s, int numRows)`

---

## Examples
Example 1:
```
Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 3
Output: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 4
Output: "PINALSIGYAHRPI"
Explanation:
P     I    N
A   L S  I G
Y A   H R
P     I
```
Example 3:
```
Input: s = "A", numRows = 1
Output: "A"
```
