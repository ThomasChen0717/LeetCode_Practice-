# LeetCode Practice Repository

This repository documents my LeetCode practice with a focus on **understanding**, not just solving.
Each solution is accompanied by notes explaining the reasoning, invariants, edge cases, and
complexity tradeoffs involved.

Problems are stored once and may be associated with multiple topics (e.g. Binary Search,
Two Pointers, Dynamic Programming). Topic overlap is documented explicitly in each problem’s README.
